    <h1>Mussoorie</h1>
      <p>Mussoorie, also known as Queen of the Hills, is among the most popular hill stations of the country. A Britisher, Captain Frederick Young, accompanied by an official named FJ Shore, had climbed up the hill from the Doon valley in 1827 and found this ridge offering great views and a salubrious climate. This visit laid the foundation for this grand hill station. 
         A captivating paradise for leisure travellers and honeymooners, it is a perfect summer resort. Located on a 15-km-long horseshoe ridge with the grand Himalayas as a backdrop, Mussoorie spreads across at a height of 2,000 m above sea level. From this vantage point, it offers scenic views of Himalayas peaks in Western Garhwal.</p>
