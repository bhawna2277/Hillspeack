    <h1>F.R.I</h1>
      <p>Forest Research Institute (FRI), Dehra Dun made a humble beginning as Forest School established in 1878. 
        Initially named as Imperial Forest Research Institute, FRI came into being in 1906.  Later renamed as Forest Research Institute and Colleges, with a number of centres located at different places all over the country administering research as well as training of 
        Forest Officers and Forest Rangers.  After reorganization of Forestry Research in the country and creation of Indian Council of Forestry Research and Education (ICFRE) in 1988, the training and research centres were given an independent status of institutes. Forest Research Institute, now one of the institutes under ICFRE, was conferred the status of Deemed University in December 1991
         on the recommendations of the UGC, Ministry of Human Resource Development, Government of India.</p>

Established as Imperial Forest Research Institute in 1906, the Forest Research Institute (FRI) Dehradun, was first situated at Chandhbagh (the present location of the Doon School) on the Mall Road. A much larger campus at the present location was acquired ca 1923. Construction of the new buildings commenced thereafter. Styled in Greco-Roman Architecture by C.G. Blomfield, the main building was inaugurated in 1929 by then Viceroy Freeman Freeman-Thomas, 1st Marquess of Willingdon. It is now a National Heritage site.
Forest Research Institute Dehradun is among the oldest institutions of its kind. The institute's history is virtually synonymous with the evolution and development of scientific forestry, not only in India, but over the entire sub-continent. Built over 450 hectares, with the outer Himalaya forming its back drop, the institute's main building combines Greco-Roman and Colonial styles of architecture, with a plinth area of 2.5 hectares. The building was listed for a time, in the Guinness Book of Records, as the largest purely brick structure in the world. The institute has a developed infrastructure of all equipped laboratories, library, herbarium, arboreta, printing press and experimental field areas for conducting forestry research. It is 7 km from Clock Tower, on the Dehradun-Chakrata motorable road. 
It is the biggest forest based training institute in India. Most of the forest officers are a part of this institute. The FRI's building also houses a Botanical Museum and there are many different kind of trees from around the world.</p>
