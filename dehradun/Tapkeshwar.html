           <hr>
            <p>The Tapkeshwar Mahadeva Temple owes its importance due to the natural Shiva Linga in the cave. 
                Long back the river flowed through the caves and continuous water droplets fell on the Shiv Linga. This became a place of reverence for the local people. 
                It is also believed that this was used as a residence by Guru Dronacharya, the esteemed teacher of the Pandavas and Kauravas of the Hindu epic Mahabharata written by Veda Vyays.
                 The cave is thus named Drona Cave after his name. When Dronacharya's wife Kalyani gave birth to Aswosthama, she didn't properly feed him with her milk. As Dronacharya was unable to afford cow or cow milk, Aswosthama, the clever child prayed to Lord Shiva. Being happy with his praying, Lord Shiva fed him milk through dripping from the Shivling in Drona cave.
